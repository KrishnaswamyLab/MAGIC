Description: MAGIC (Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells) is a method for addressing technical noise in single-cell data, including under-sampling of mRNA molecules, often termed "dropout" which can severely obscure important gene-gene relationships. MAGIC shares information across similar cells, via data diffusion, to denoise the cell count matrix and fill in missing transcripts. Read more: van Dijk et al.
