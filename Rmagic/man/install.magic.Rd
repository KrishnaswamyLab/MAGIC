\description{
Install PHATE Python package into a virtualenv or conda env.
}
\details{
On Linux and OS X the "virtualenv" method will be used by default
("conda" will be used if virtualenv isn't available). On Windows,
the "conda" method is always used.
As of reticulate v1.7, this functionality is only available in the
development version of reticulate, which can be installed using
`devtools::install_github('rstudio/reticulate')`
}
